Here is the list of futures that needs to be implemented.
The order represents importance and/or dependency.
* World generation
* Fire lighting
* Sun lighting
* Textures
* Building/destroying
* GPU-side allocator for chunk vertices - in order to allow to some chunks have huge meshes but use not so huge overall vertex buffer
* Variable number of chunks in the world
* World movement
* Chunks save/load
* Flowing water
* Growing grass
* Fire (that burns some blocks)
* Player collision against the world
* Settings
* Plates (half-blocks)
* Vertically-splitted half-blocks
* Sky drawing (sky, sun, clouds)
* Rain
* Time of day change
* GUI
