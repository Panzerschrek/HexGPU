Here is the list of futures that needs to be implemented.
The order represents importance and/or dependency.
* World generation - support different block types
* Fire lighting
* Sun lighting
* Building/destroying
* Textues config - with different textures for different block types and sides
* GPU-side allocator for chunk vertices - in order to allow to some chunks have huge meshes but use not so huge overall vertex buffer
* Variable number of chunks in the world
* World movement
* Chunks save/load
* Flowing water
* Growing grass
* Improved textures loading - use smaller staging buffer and free it at the end of the loading process
* Biome-based world generation
* Trees generation
* Fire (that burns some blocks)
* Player collision against the world
* Settings
* Anisotropy textures filtering
* Plates (half-blocks)
* Vertically-splitted half-blocks
* Sky drawing (sky, sun, clouds)
* Rain
* Time of day change
* GUI
